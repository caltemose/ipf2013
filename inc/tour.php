                <p>This wonderful 1906 bungalow was purchased by Karen and Kevin Green in 1991. &ldquo;At the time, it was the worst house on the street,&rdquo; says Karen. No two windows matched, it had fake brick instead of a front porch, all the ceilings had been lowered to 8 feet, and just about everything original had been stripped out except for the heart pine floors. &ldquo;I remember being asked if were going to &lsquo;keep the house&rsquo; or tear it down. But there was never any question in our minds,&rdquo; says Kevin.</p>
                <p>Well, what followed was more than a year of rebuilding, working nights, weekends and vacations. Kevin had been a carpenter during college and grad school and so these newlyweds teamed up to do much of the work themselves.</p>
                <p>The result is a transformation that is nothing short of amazing. A strikingly attractive and open floor plan, the ceilings back to original height, an upstairs, and &ldquo;all new everything&rdquo; other than the pine floors which were preserved wherever possible. Recent improvements include a &ldquo;re-renovation&rdquo; of the main floor with a new kitchen, baths and much more, and digging out the dirt basement and crawlspace to create a &ldquo;man-cave&rdquo; that was recently featured in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, with most materials being recycled or reused.</p>
                <p>A must-see is the fabulous screened-in porch and deck, the 50 ft. tall rope swing out back (suitable for all ages), the outdoor shower, and the one-acre park off the backyard that is shared by 10 neighbors.</p>
                <p>Now home to their two daughters Mia (12) and Maris (10) as well, &ldquo;this is a house we don&rsquo;t ever plan to leave,&rdquo; says Kevin.</p>
